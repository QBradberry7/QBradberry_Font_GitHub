	<p id="first_font">On Friday, I went to school, and was almost late to class. Then, after school, I went home and just played video games untilI got tired.</p>

	<p id="second_font"> On Saturday, I just laid back and did nothing all day. All I did that day was play video games, listen to music, watch TV, etc.</p>

	<p id="third_font"> On Sunday, I got sick, and I was told I still had to go to school the next day. I was pretty upset.</p>
